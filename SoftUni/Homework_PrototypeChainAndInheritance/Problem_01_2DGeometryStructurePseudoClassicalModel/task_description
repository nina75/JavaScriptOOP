/*Define a function constructor Shape. Define the following types of shapes:
•	Circle – holds a center point O with coordinates x and y (written for simplicity as O(x, y)). Also has a radius r (number) and a color (in hexadecimal format)
•	Rectangle – holds the coordinates of its top left corner A(x, y), width (number), height (number) and color (in hexadecimal format)
•	Triangle – consists of three points A(x, y), B(x, y) and C(x, y). Also has a color (in hexadecimal format)
•	Line – holds two points A(x, y) and B(x, y), has a color (in hexadecimal format)
•	Segment – consists of two endpoints A(x, y) and B(x, y), also has a color (in hexadecimal format)
Override the toString() method to print information about each object. Add all shapes in a module.*/
